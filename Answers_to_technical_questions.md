## 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

For the past three days that I had to complete the challenge, i have spent around 5h per day on it, so 15h in total. If I had more time, I would like to add a button so the user has the option to see all the restaurants in that outcode area, not only the "currently open" ones that are initially rendered. I would like to fix the error i'm getting that has consumed a lot of the time to complete the challenge that is not allowing me to render properly the information from the RestaurantsList constant, and to make it more complete I would have React router library, so the user could click on each restaurant and open it in a different page with more detailed information about it. I would also like to add some tests, such as check if the API URL corresponds to the desired one, if the outcode searched exist or if the component with the list of restaurants has been successfully rendered.

## 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

I have chosen the language react and due to the dimension of the app I have not used any of the features from the latest version of React, version 18, yet there is one library I have used to go around the CORS issue that was extremely helpful, being that the Mock Service Worker.

## 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

The best way to track performance issues I would say it is by running tests, specially on the user side to see how fast the program is running, if it has any rendering issues and also in multiple devises. I didn't have the opportunity yet to conduct such tests due to my still junior status in this field, but I would be glad to do it and learn more about it.
